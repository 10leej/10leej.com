<h1>Hello internet!</h1>
<h2>Welcome to <a href="ww.10leej.com">10leej.com</a></h2>
<p>This is just a super basic front page I put here to kind've server as a generic <a href="https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Placeholder">placeholder</a> and offer up a few links to the service's you can find here.<br>
First off this server is based in Atlanta, Georgia and is hosted by a $5 Linode VPS. If for some reason you're experiencing lag, that is likely the cause of it. Don't be afraid to support the cause!</p>
<h2><a href="planarally.10leej.com">Planar Ally</a> v0.19.3</h2>
<p>Planar Ally is free and open source Virtual Tabletop created by a madman by the name of Kruptein who takes pride in his work like none other I've seen. You can support the developement <a href="https://github.com/Kruptein/PlanarAlly">here</a>.<br>
<a href="www.planarally.io">Planar Ally Documentation</a>  </p>
<h2><a href="https://dokuwiki.10leej.com/">Dokuwiki</a></h2>
<p>Is a free and open source wiki, just like Wikipedia! It's fresh to this server and largely unconfigured. But, it will eventually hold all my D&amp;D Campaign information.  </p>
<h1><a href="https://www.patreon.com/10leej">Support the Cause!</a></h1>
<p>This is currently a passion project, but the domain name costs me $10/yr and the server itself is another $5 a month (as of this time of writing). Not to mention the email access is an extra $12/month. Bring me to a grand total of $17.84 a month. Plus the more I earn, the better I can expand on this or even the content I create.  </p>
