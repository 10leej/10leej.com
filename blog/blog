# Hello internet!
## Welcome to 10leej.com

This is just a super basic front page I put here to kind've server as a generic placeholder and offer up a few links to the service's you can find here.  
First off this server is based in Atlanta, Georgia and is hosted by a $5 Linode VPS. If for some reason you're experiencing lag, that is likely the cause of it. Don't be afraid to support the cause!  
### [Planar Ally](planarally.10leej.com) v0.19.3
Planar Ally is free and open source Virtual Tabletop created by a madman by the name of Kruptein who takes pride in his work like none other I've seen. You can support the developement [here](https://github.com/Kruptein/PlanarAlly). You can find documentation [here as well](https://www.planarally.io/)  
This server also hosts a [beta version of Planar Ally](http://10leej.com:8080) as well

### [Dokuwiki](https://wiki.10leej.com/)
Is a free and open source wiki, just like Wikipedia! It's fresh to this server and largely unconfigured. But, it will eventually hold all my D&D Campaign information.  

### [Support the Cause!](https://www.patreon.com/10leej)
This is currently a passion project, but the domain name costs me $10/yr and the server itself is another $5 a month (as of this time of writing). Not to mention the email access is an extra $12/month. Bring me to a grand total of $17.84 a month. Plus the more I earn, the better I can expand on this or even the content I create.
