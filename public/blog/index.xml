      <description>So last thurday I got woken up by a phone call from the temporary office I was employed with. The company I was contracted to work with elected to terminate me citing that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t following instruction from someone I never heard of.
Talk about a bad time, at this point in my life for the year 2020 I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time unemployed, than employed and honestly life&amp;rsquo;s been rough for me.</description>

      <description>This is a repost, from something I wrote last year. &amp;ldquo;There may be some offensive language in this article&amp;rdquo; ~Joshua Lee, Editor/Writer 10leej.com
And for the love of all that could potentially be holy. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget your towel!
Let me show you something&amp;hellip;.
Yes, that is my hand, radio, and safety glasses. Their all a little dirty, same with this table in the lunch room where I took this photo on my cheapo smartphone.</description>
