      <description>Preface: Jabeddo is by far my most developped D&amp;amp;D character, born in 3.5 with his story ending in 5e. Jabeddo was literally the third character I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made in a tabletop RPG game.
I&amp;rsquo;m renaming locations to match my campaign setting Tor&amp;rsquo;Dath as Jabeddo is so well developed I think his story should be cannon.
Character Creation The DM prior to character creation had us all roll dice to determine who was in jail, and who was not.</description>
