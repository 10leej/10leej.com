# I have this document I've sign every year.  
It's an interesting phenominon, a simple set of 12 rules that just last year was accompanied with a [set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0k1L4404P4_EMKDK6gF46ldqjX2uAPF3). Yes I have signed the [S.W.E.A.T. pledge](https://www.mikeroweworks.org/sweat/).  
I sign it every year as a reminder to myself, for what I wish to achieve. I'm sure some of you noticed my [repost of an older post](https://10leej.com/the-meaning-of-life-and-everything-is-42/) where I talk about my uh... *religion*.  
Well today as I'm just over a week into yet another a temporary job my boss asked him how I liked my job. I told her I'm more or less indifferent, but do enjoy the fact that I basically have constant work without the expectations of *get it done yesterday*.  
Well she then said something more or less that I have never heard someone tell me before...  

*"You work harder than anyone else I've ever seen here."*

My immediate thought is "Who the hell have you been hiring?" thankfully I never said that. Instead I went back to work. Tossing cardboard off of pallets, plastic bags, and what not onto a conveyer belt that took it to a compactor to get smashed into a wonder bale of... cardboard.  
Later during my lunch break I walked out to my car and got a sheet of paper out, and brough it to her. This sheet is laminated, has a list of twelve rules with my name scribbled multiple times on the bottom with the date ranging the last five years.  
This paper is my life's work. Yes I didn't write those words, the guy in the links above did that for me, but I'm using them. I'm reciting them. And thus, I try to live by them.  

It's been a wild ride, I've seen if not it all. Then a lot.
