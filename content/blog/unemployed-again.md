So last thurday I got woken up by a phone call from the temporary office I was employed with. The company I was contracted to work with elected to terminate me citing that I wasn't following instruction from someone I never heard of.  

Talk about a bad time, at this point in my life for the year 2020 I've spent more time unemployed, than employed and honestly life's been rough for me. Last year wasn't really particularly great, and honestly I blame me, myself, and I for the situation I'm in now. At this point in time, I don't know what to do.  
In the state of Ohio, where I live, all the books say I'm elgible for unemployment benefits. However my most recent claim was once again... Denied.  

In the meantime my application count is well and above 1,000 and I've applied for work everywhere I could think of prior to this most recent position. But, alas I've been a bit too reckless with the income from the last job. So maybe, this is karma? Who knows.  

It's awkward to think of all the things I've done and how at this point my cost of living is still relatively low compared to the [rest of the nation](https://transferwise.com/us/blog/cost-of-living-in-the-usa).  
And yet for some reason I can't bring myself to hold a job. Since Janurary 8th I've working nothing but temporary positions and a short stint with a contruction crew I voluntarily resigned from. Likely that was my mistake right there.  

Anywys, now that i'm done writing this, i guess I'll get in the car and hope and pray I can finally get a phone call soon. Because at this point I'm not even sure I can pay my phone bill this upcoming month and yet I'm apparently not elgible for any form of unemployment assistance.
