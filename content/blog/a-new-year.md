## January 1st
Welp I woke up yesterday morning hangover free thanks to me being a party pooper and going to bed at like 9pm. I install opensuse tumbleweed on my desktop PC with a New Year's Resolution to not reinstall my linux distro. I'm hoping the btrfs snapshots I setup work for this.  
That said Im well aware I can go long term on a single distro, I ran debian stable for almost six years, but my poor decision to invest in a 5700XT has kinda forced me to hop around a little. I ran Fedora 32 for most of the year but there's a few things about the distro that kinda irk me a bit, plus the recent CentOS news means I need to find a new server OS to eventually migrate to.  

## Why openSUSE?
So I voiced my opinion on the kind of distro I wanted and I got a few responses from Archlinux, Solus, Manjaro, Ubuntu and so on. Ideally I wanted a rolling release or semi-rolling release distro with a focus on stability and desktop use. This eliminated Ubuntu entirely and the aggressive pace of updates for Archlinux were a bit much for me.  
I also have issues with the Manjaro project, but ultimately I could see myself running the distro. But meh, the arch ecosystem is cool and all. But I did kinda want to try something new. So that left Solus, and openSUSE. I've used Solus in the past and in fact it was the first Linux Distribution I truely fell in love with.   But, there's a reason I quit using it and thats the packaging philosophy of the Solus project currating specifically desktop use.  
This makes Solus a very targetted distro at someone "not me" and while I dislike it, I don't exactly disagree with them. So that naturally left me with... openSUSE. A distro I quite literally have never considered using before now.  
I took some time to dig through some documentation figure out this YasT2 thing and went into the instalation phase. I said screw it to Gnome, Plasma, or XFCE "we're going the real man's route" find out when you select "basic desktop" which left me with IceWM. Which for a floating manager doesn;t seem all that bad. But, I installed awesome nonetheless electing to the [config](https://github.com/10leej/awesome) file I've been working off and on now for a while.

## What about WoW?
I'll be honest I've been kinda bored of World of Warcraft and while the Shadowlands expansion has been a great refresher I found myself with nothing I really wanted to strive for since getting my Loremaster title. So rather than leaving the game when I'm completely bored of it, I'll just leave it now until I have a reason to pick it up again.  

## Non-IT Things
So besides whats on my computer I'm in a pretty decent spot right now. Still financially poor yes, but not broke anymore. Currently I've recovered from 2020 fairly well with a little over a single month's savings left, thankfully I've been building that emergency fund back up, the goal is to get back to the $6k again which is reasonable when I can easily put $1k a month right into savings. My cheap bastard life style is paying off, kinda.
