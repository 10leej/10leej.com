# I give up
So I said not even a day ago I switch to openSUSE for 2021, well that didn't quite work out. You see openSUSE just was too different to be my daily driver as a window manager user and honestly zypper just grew frustrating to wait on. YasT was openSUSE's saving grace but for some reason no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get my IP printer working.  
You see I have two printers in my home, a canon scanner/printer combo which openSUSE saw fine, and a Brother laser printer connected over the network. So after some brief thoughts, I elected to just go back to Fedora which was my distro of choice for 2020. But instead of my awesomeWM setup I still wanted to try something new.

I'm still working on refining it a bit but I think I got dwm working pretty well for me. I haven't gotten to theming it yet, but I'm enjoying my work here quite a bit more than with awesome.  
For example unlike awesome I find dwm's config.h file a lot better organized overall even though I have no idea how to program in C. But hey I got time and a willingness to learn so whatever. Eventually I'll have it all setup proper but currently I have all my suckless tools in one [git repo](https://github.com/10leej/suckless) if you want to give them a try.
