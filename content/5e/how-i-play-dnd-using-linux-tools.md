## Why Linux?
I use Linux as my primary operating system purely as personal preference. If you've looked at my [previous post](https://10leej.com/a-new-year/) you'll know I prefer to use Tiling Window Managers these days and honestly using Windows 10 or even MacOS just feels.... wrong to me.  
So allow me a momnent before I dig into these tools I need to make the disclaimer that they aren't all open source or even free. I'll list the two proprietary ones last

## Planar Ally
So if you scroll up on my website you'll see that I use [Planar Ally](https://www.planarally.io/) as my Virtual Desktop of choice. The dev behind it Kruptein has been very [responsive to feedback](https://github.com/Kruptein/planarally) and has put a ton of effort behind making PA the best solution possible. I even makde a [low effort video](https://youtu.be/Ch81VoAmnPI) on it.

## Jitsi-Meet
So really any standard voice communication tool would work, but I livestream my campaign and the players liked the idea of a camera feed. So really Jitsi-Meet was really the most straightforward tool for this as I find it's got the best latency and the most reliable connection.

## Kanka.IO
Ok so I'm still new to this wonderful tool, but if you've seen advertisements for [WorldAnvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/), [Kanka](https://kanka.io/) does everything that does. At first when you look around the site you'd think it's not open source, but that's wrong. It in fact is open, and [here's the git repo](https://github.com/ilestis/miscellany) they use the paid tiers to support their developers as well as pay for the server hosting.

## Wonderdraft
Ok so here's something I haven't really shown much. But this is the first proprietary application and it's a world map making tool. [Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net/) is my preference for drawing a world map, and honestly that's only because it makes it easy. Unlike other solutions it's a one time purchase too for as little as $30.

## Dungeondraft
So made by the same guys behind Wonderdraft, [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) has very recently hit not only version 1.0 after a very successful beta, but it also recently had a native Linux port. I admit it's still buggy but like it for many of the same reasons I like Wonderdraft. It's a One time purchase (this time for $20) and it's got a MASSIVE community around it.

## FOSS alternatives
So I know there's an interest in alternatives to the last two, and honestly I don't really recommend them personally. But if you need to draw dungeons, you can do that in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) although it's a bit gimmicky.  
You can also use [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/) which is an old school solution and has a learning curce. But, it's been the standard for years for being that sotfware tool behind all the maps you see used on the fancy TV tables. If you're a maptool user, go ahead and keep using it I wont stop you. But if you're new to the hobby, I highly recommend Dungeondraft.  
If you need a WorldMap I honestly can only point to [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), while yes you can draw a map in GIMP, Krita is just the better option IMO.

Why do I use the proprietary tools though? It's simply and unfortunately convenience. While I'm an advocate for FOSS tools I'm also very aware of Time vs Effort as someone who has a backround in operating businesses and managing sales/political/logistical campaigns.  
While I love the stuff people can make using the FOSS tools I mentioned I just simply dont want to put the time or effort into making them work, for me.  

If you want a true FOSS alternative to Kanka.IO you can simply use one of hundreds of wiki solutions as well. I prefer [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)

## How I stream my campaign
So I do stream my campaigns more to my own players request and mostly because I can. You can catch my live every Saturday at 7pm on my YouTube channel. That's also where I save my VODs as well even though I've flirted with the idea of uploading them to LBRY at times.  
So how do I stream? Well with the one solution for streaming in general: [OBS-Studio](https://obsproject.com/).  
To capture the camera feeds I use a Chromium plugin called [Pop-out Jitsi Meet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-out-jitsi-meet/boklbbjieahngbnhdmlhldjjibdnnbcn?hl=en) which is FOSS [Git Link](https://github.com/Jip-Hop/jitsi-pop). I simply load everyone into a multiview screen and capture it as a Window source in OBS.  

## Conclusion
So that's pretty much it. I won't really go into making guides on using these tools especially since a few of them are still relatively brand new and quite aggressively maintained.
I do use Discord for finding and talking with my current set of players, but if you want to talk with me I have [this one available](https://discord.gg/cUfbCBF), I'm also available on all the social links found on the [homepage of this website](https://10leej.com).
